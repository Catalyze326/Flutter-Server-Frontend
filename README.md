# Server Frontend

An app to interface with my servers

For now it has a couple of features. 

It can auto start servers with a project that a friend of mine created (Git url will be added when he finishes open sourcing it).

It can grab the data from my microcenter scraper to display that easily in the app.

It can let me know if my servers apps are running properly and soon it will be able to restart them.

It can automatically deploy code to remote servers from my github.

More documentation will be added soon.
